# PysparkUnitTestCaseGenerator
The GenAI-PySpark Unit Test Generator simplifies the process of creating unit test cases for PySpark code by leveraging the power of AI content generation.

GenAI-PySpark Unit Test Generator
This Streamlit application facilitates the generation of unit test cases for PySpark code using the Google Generative AI service.
Prerequisites
1.	Streamlit: Streamlit is a Python library used for creating web applications with simple Python scripts. Install it using pip install streamlit.
2.	Google Generative AI: The application leverages the Google Generative AI service for content generation. You need to have access to the service and obtain an API key. Install the library using pip install google-generativeai.
3.	dotenv: The application uses environment variables stored in a .env file. Install the library using pip install python-dotenv.
Setup
1.	Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the project directory and store your Google API key as GOOGLE_API_KEY.
plaintextCopy code
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here 
2.	Configure Gemini Pro API: Load the environment variables and configure the Generative AI service with the API key.
Usage
1.	Run the Application: Execute the Python script containing the provided code. The Streamlit application will start locally.
bashCopy code
streamlit run your_script.py 
2.	Upload PySpark Code File: Use the file uploader to select the PySpark code file for which you want to generate unit tests.
3.	Generate Unit Test Cases: Click on the "Generate Unit Test Cases" button to trigger the unit test generation process.
4.	View Generated Test Cases: The application will display the content of the uploaded code file and the generated unit test cases.
Code Explanation
•	main() Function: Entry point of the application. It sets up the Streamlit interface and handles user interactions.
•	File Uploader: Allows users to upload PySpark code files.
•	Generate Unit Test Cases Button: Triggers the generation of unit test cases.
•	Prompt Creation: Constructs a prompt for the AI model using the uploaded code file content.
•	GenerativeModel: Initializes the Generative AI model for content generation.
•	generate_content() Method: Calls the model to generate unit test cases based on the provided prompt.
•	Display Generated Test Cases: Renders the generated unit test cases on the Streamlit interface.
Conclusion
The GenAI-PySpark Unit Test Generator simplifies the process of creating unit test cases for PySpark code by leveraging the power of AI content generation.
